1.	After reviewing the code, I concluded that to implement a more least privileged configuration I would need to create 2 security groups. In the network.tf file I would change the existing security group into a public SG that only allows access from port 80 and 443 and not all traffic as it was before. I would accomplish this by changing the ingress and egress of the SG to reflect the necessary ports. I would then create a second SG in the same file and configure it to block all outside traffic except for traffic from the public security group. In the Compute.tf file, I would then make changes on line 21 to associate the Red Hat instances with the private security group and on line 36 to associate the load balancers with the public security group. After these changes are made all traffic using port 80 or 443 will travel through the load balancers which will then navigate to the EC2 instances that are allowing traffic from the public security group through the private security group.
